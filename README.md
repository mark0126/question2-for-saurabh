__name__ and __main__

Hello Saurabh, I'm going to annoy you with another beginner's question, haha.

The book I'm reading explains that if you create python files they can later be imported, and for convenience the python programmer should commit to using this format:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    
    Could you break down the meanings of __name__ and the string "__main__" for me?  that would be helpful.  thanks
